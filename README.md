Implementation of a simulation of a biological neural network based on the ADEX model with pre- and post-synaptic expression of STDP in C.

Doxygen documentation in /doc/html/index.html

Main of ported code in *simulation.c*

Original python code in *prepostSTDP_savings.py* is responsible for running the desired simulation in the BRIAN neural network simulator
